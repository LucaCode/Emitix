## What is Emitix
***Emitix*** is a high performance, modern, lightweight, and typesafe EventEmitter. 
The EventEmitter is highly optimized that making it one of the fastest EventEmitter available for Node.js and the browser (See benchmarks below).
The API is slightly different compared to the default shipped EventEmitter of Node.js.

## How to use Emitix

### Basic usage

```typescript
import EventEmitter, {EventListener} from "emitix";

interface User {
    id: string
    name: string
}

const groupEmitter = new EventEmitter<{
    join: [User],
    leave: [User,number]
}>();

//Adds an on-listener that gets invoked every time when the event fires.
groupEmitter.on("join", user => {})

//Adds a once-listener that gets invoked when the event fires and will be removed.
groupEmitter.once("join",user => {})

//Without a callback/listener, the once method returns a promise.
//An optional timeout can be provided as a second argument.
groupEmitter.once("join",5000).then(([user]) => {
    console.log(`A user: ${user.name} joined in time.`);
}).catch(() => {
    console.log("Timeout occurred...");
})

//Removes all on/once listeners from every event of the emitter.
groupEmitter.off();

//Removes all on/once listeners of the join event.
groupEmitter.off("join");

//EventListener utility type can be used to
//create a typesafe listener function as a variable.
const leaveListener: EventListener<typeof groupEmitter,"leave"> = (user,stayedSeconds) => {};
groupEmitter.on("leave", leaveListener)

//Removes the specific listener from the leave event.
groupEmitter.off("leave",leaveListener);

//Triggers an event.
//It will call every listener of the event with the provided arguments.
groupEmitter.emit("join",{id: "Q124",name: "Emitixa"});
groupEmitter.emit("leave",{id: "Q022",name: "Slowix"},2000);

//Returns currently registered events as a string array.
groupEmitter.events();

//Returns the count of listeners of every event.
groupEmitter.listenerCount();

//Returns the count of listeners of a specific event.
groupEmitter.listenerCount("join");
```

### Protected class event emitter
Use the Emitix event emitter with a class and let only the class trigger events internally.

```typescript
import EventEmitter from "emitix";

class Broker extends EventEmitter.Protected<{
    message: [string],
    error: [Error]
}>() {
    foo() {
        //Everything is okay
        this.emit("message","Hello!");
    }
}

const broker = new Broker();

//ERROR: Will not work emit is protected...
broker.emit("message","Hello from outside!");

//Everything is okay
broker.on("message", message => {})
```
